## 1. Rural Electrification Administration (REA) Claims

### Claim: 2% fixed interest rate after 1944 Pace Act
**Status: ACCURATE**

The 1944 Pace Act (formally the Department of Agriculture Organic Act of 1944) reduced REA loan interest rates to 2% and made this rate fixed. Prior to 1944, the interest rate matched the federal funds rate at the time the loan was executed.

---

### Claim: 35-year loan repayment period
**Status: ACCURATE**

The 1944 Pace Act extended the loan repayment period from the original 25 years to 35 years. This 35-year term remains a feature of successor programs under the Rural Utilities Service today.

---

### Claim: >99% repayment rate
**Status: VERIFIED**

Multiple authoritative sources confirm the default rate was less than 1%, corresponding to a repayment rate over 99%:
- EH.net explicitly states "the default rate was less than one percent"
- Richmond Fed confirms "the default rate was less than 1 percent"
- As of December 31, 2011, the Rural Utilities Service reported only 10 borrowers whose loans had been foreclosed or settled, out of over 1,000 total borrowers tracked historically

### Claim: $57-150 billion deployed in today's dollars
**Status: NEEDS CLARIFICATION**

The $57 billion figure represents nominal (unadjusted) cumulative loans through the REA and its successor RUS. The initial $100 million authorization in 1936 equals approximately $1.88-2 billion in 2020 dollars. A properly inflation-adjusted total would likely fall in the $100-200 billion range.

**Recommendation:** Cite $57 billion as "nominal cumulative loans" or provide methodology for inflation adjustment.

### Claim: ~10% of farms electrified in 1935, 93% by 1955
**Status: ACCURATE**

- 1935: 10-11% of farms had electricity (NRECA cites 10.9% or 744,000 farms)
- 1940: ~25% of farms electrified
- 1950: ~80-90% of farms electrified
- 1953: Over 90% of farms electrified
- 1963: 99% of all farms had power

### Claim: 42 UHV lines operational in China vs. 2 in rest of world combined
**Status: CHINA COUNT ACCURATE; REST OF WORLD UNDERSTATED**

By end of 2024, China had 42 UHV AC/DC projects operational (38 managed by State Grid, 4 by China Southern Power Grid). However, Brazil alone has at least 2 operational 800kV UHVDC lines, plus India has additional projects. China still has the overwhelming majority.

### Claim: China grid growth at 7%/year, twice the US rate
**Status: ACCURATE (actually understated)**

China's electricity demand growth averaged 7% per year in 2023-2024 (6.8% in 2024, adding 623 TWh). The US has grown by less than 1% annually over the past two decades. China's rate is actually closer to 7x the US's typical rate, not just twice.

### Claim: HVDC lines spanning 2,000 miles with 3-year construction times
**Status: ACCURATE**

The Changji-Guquan ±1100kV UHVDC line spans 3,324 km (approximately 2,066 miles) from Xinjiang to Anhui province. Construction started in January 2016 and was completed in December 2018, confirming the 3-year timeline. The line can transmit 12 GW of power.

### Claim: China's cost of capital for grid investment ~2-3%
**Status: ESTIMATED (indirect evidence)**

No direct source confirms State Grid's exact cost of capital. However, indirect evidence supports the 2-3% range:
- China's 1-year Loan Prime Rate is 3.0%; 5-year rate is 3.5%
- PBOC offers targeted lending facilities at 2% or lower for priority sectors
- State Grid enjoys preferential credit access as a major SOE with implicit government guarantees
- SOEs typically borrow at significantly lower rates than private entities

The figure is presented as an estimate ("est.") in the document to reflect this uncertainty.

## 3. Infrastructure Scaling Laws & Economies of Scale

### Claim: Economies of scale apply to grid infrastructure
**Status: ACCURATE**

Grid infrastructure exhibits strong economies of scale, though the specific scaling exponents vary by equipment type:

- **For transformers:** Cost scales with capacity according to a **0.75 power law** (C₂ = C₁ × (S₂/S₁)^0.75). Doubling transformer capacity increases cost by approximately 68%, not 100%.
- **For transmission lines:** Economies of scale follow voltage-class relationships rather than a simple power law. Higher voltage lines achieve dramatically lower cost per MW (765kV is ~29% the cost per MW of 345kV).
- **For power plants:** The classic "six-tenths rule" (0.6 exponent) originated in chemical engineering but power plant scaling typically uses exponents of 0.7-0.85 depending on technology.

The document's core claim that economies of scale exist in grid infrastructure is well-supported by DOE research and industry data.

## 4. FERC Return on Equity (ROE) Claims

### Claim: Base ROE of 9.9-10.0%
**Status: ACCURATE**

The most recent FERC determination for MISO transmission owners established a base ROE of 9.98% (October 2024). Earlier orders set ROEs at 9.88% (2019) and 10.02% (2020 rehearing).

---

### Claim: RTO participation adder of +0.5%
**Status: ACCURATE**

The RTO participation adder of 0.5% (50 basis points) is confirmed FERC policy since the mid-2000s. Note: State regulators are actively lobbying to eliminate this adder, and a Sixth Circuit court ruling in January 2025 directed FERC to strip this adder from Duke Energy and FirstEnergy Ohio utilities.

### Claim: MISO transmission owners collected 12.38% ROE for nearly two decades before 2019 ruling
**Status: ACCURATE**

FERC confirmed that 12.38% was the ROE used by most MISO transmission owners since 2002. In Opinion No. 569 (November 21, 2019), FERC determined this rate was "unjust and unreasonable."

**Sources:**

---

### Claim: MISO ROE reduced to 9.98% after 2019 ruling
**Status: PARTIALLY ACCURATE (timing correction needed)**

The 9.98% figure is correct, but it was established in the October 2024 order, not directly in 2019. The progression was:
- 2019 (Opinion No. 569): ROE reduced to 9.88%
- 2020 (Rehearing order): ROE revised to 10.02%
- 2022: D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the orders
- October 2024 (Order on Remand): ROE set at 9.98%

## 5. Historical US Electricity Demand Growth

### Claim: 7-10% per year for "most of American history"
**Status: PARTIALLY ACCURATE - Overstated timeframe**

The 7-10% growth rates were concentrated primarily in the 1950s-1960s electrification era:
- **1950s-1960s**: Growth rates were 5-10%, often hitting close to or over 10%
- **1970s**: Growth dropped to 3-4% range
- **1980s-1990s**: Slowed to 2-3% per year
- **2000s-2020s**: Fell to less than 1% per year

**Recommendation:** Revise to "during the mid-20th century electrification era" or "1950s-1960s."

- [Visualizing Energy - United States Electricity History](https://visualizingenergy.org/united-states-electricity-history-in-four-charts/)

---

### Claim: Current US grid growth rate ~1%/year
**Status: ACCURATE (recently even lower)**

- From 2008-2021, growth averaged only 0.1% per year
- From 2014-2024, US electrical demand grew at 0.5% CAGR
- The EIA's AEO2023 Reference case projects annual growth averaging about 1% from 2022 through 2050
- However, 2024 saw a 3.0% increase (+128 TWh), marking a significant acceleration

### Claim: REA era growth rate 8%/year
**Status: PLAUSIBLE**

The REA period (1935-1960s) saw dramatic expansion. The 1950s-1960s definitely saw 8-10% growth rates nationally. Farm electrification went from less than 10% in 1930 to over 90% by 1959.

## 6. Grid Reliability and Interconnection

### Claim: The 1965 blackout triggered the largest transmission expansion in American history
**Status: PARTIALLY ACCURATE - Better characterized as reliability reforms**

The 1965 blackout led to the formation of NERC (National Electric Reliability Council) in 1968 and established voluntary reliability standards. The post-1965 period focused largely on reliability upgrades and reorganization rather than pure expansion.

**Recommendation:** Revise to "triggered major reliability reforms and coordination improvements."

---

### Claim: Operating reserves scale with the square root of system size
**Status: SUPPORTED**

This follows from statistical aggregation theory for uncorrelated random variables. NREL confirms: "Individual loads are highly uncorrelated. The relative Regulating Reserves needed to achieve acceptable performance are consequently lower for larger balancing areas than for smaller balancing areas."

**Sources:**
- [NREL - Operating Reserves and Variable Generation](https://docs.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/51978.pdf)
- [ESIG - Setting Operating Reserve Requirements](https://www.esig.energy/setting-operating-reserve-requirements-on-an-evolving-power-system/)

---

### Claim: Combining 4 regions reduces reserve needs by ~50%
**Status: STRONGLY SUPPORTED**

A PNNL-led study (funded by DOE) found that "the consolidated WECC will have about a 50% overall reduction in balancing reserves in comparison with total reserve requirements that need to be carried by different BAs if they operate individually."

### Claim: Geographic diversity reduces renewable variability by 40-60%
**Status: SUPPORTED**

- UK study: 36% reduction in variance through interconnection of wind farms
- European studies: 50% reduction when aggregating from France to all of Europe
- A 10x10 array of PV plants with 20 km spacing shows "six times less" variability than a single site

### Claim: Strong interconnection reduces wholesale electricity costs by 15-25%
**Status: PARTIALLY SUPPORTED - Consider more specific figures**

- University of Chicago study: ~5% or roughly $3 billion in production cost savings
- LBL research: $5.8-7.1 billion reduction from eliminating interregional constraints (2022)
- MISO estimates $3.2-$4 billion in annual savings compared to operations without an RTO

**Recommendation:** Consider citing specific RTO savings figures rather than the 15-25% range.

## 7. Transmission Voltage Capacity

### Claim: 345 kV single circuit capacity ~400 MW
**Status: ACCURATE**

AEP states that a 345 kV line with bundled conductors can deliver about 400 MW for distances up to 300 miles.

**Sources:**
- [AEP Transmission Facts](https://web.ecs.baylor.edu/faculty/grady/_13_EE392J_2_Spring11_AEP_Transmission_Facts.pdf)
- [Iowa State University - Capacity of Transmission Lines](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/files/2021/03/EnergyProject_Capacity_of_Transmission_Lines.pdf)

---

### Claim: 500 kV single circuit capacity ~900 MW
**Status: ACCURATE**

AEP explicitly states a 500 kV line with bundled conductors can deliver "only about 900 MW for distances up to 300 miles." Shorter distances allow higher loading (up to 1,100+ MW).

**Sources:**
- [AEP Transmission Facts](https://web.ecs.baylor.edu/faculty/grady/_13_EE392J_2_Spring11_AEP_Transmission_Facts.pdf)

---

### Claim: 765 kV double circuit capacity ~4000 MW
**Status: ACCURATE**

Power Grid Corporation of India's 765 kV Double Circuit Vindhyachal-Varanasi transmission line enhanced inter-regional power transfer capacity by 4,200 MW.

**Sources:**
- [Government of India Press Release](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1748809)
- [MISO Discussion of 765 kV](https://cdn.misoenergy.org/20230308%20PAC%20Item%2007%20Discussion%20of%20765%20kV%20and%20HVDC628088.pdf)

---

### Claim: 500 kV requires similar right-of-way as 345 kV but carries twice the power
**Status: MOSTLY ACCURATE**

- 345 kV: Typically 150 feet ROW
- 500 kV: Typically 175 feet ROW (17% wider)
- Power capacity: 900 MW vs 400 MW (2.25x increase)

The claim of "roughly the same" ROW for "roughly twice the power" is substantively correct.

**Sources:**
- [AEP Encroachments on ROW](https://aeptransmission.com/dist/docs/property/EncroachmentOnROW_AEPTrans-V2.pdf)

---

### Claim: 765 kV achieves 80% lower cost per MW vs 345 kV
**Status: ACCURATE**

AEP analysis states 765 kV construction is "only 29% of the cost of 345-kV and 38% of the cost of 500 kV for equivalent power transfer capability" - a 71% reduction, close to the claimed 80%.

## 8. International and Financing Comparisons

### Claim: US private transmission financing at 7-10%
**Status: ACCURATE**

- FERC allows transmission owners ROE around 9.9-10.5%, with adders potentially pushing to 11-11.5%
- NREL calculated IOU WACC from 2010-2020 ranged from 5.8% to 6.4% (after-tax)
- Transmission owners can receive high rates of return of about 10%-12%

- [UC Berkeley - Reducing Financing Costs for New Transmission](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/research/clee/research/climate/renewable-energy/financing-transmission/)

---

### Claim: Federal borrowing at 2% is reasonable
**Status: HISTORICALLY ACCURATE (current rates higher)**

- The REA operated at 2% interest rates (fixed after 1944 Pace Act)
- Current 10-year Treasury yields: 4.0-4.5% range
- A policy establishing special 2% rates for grid infrastructure would require explicit Congressional authorization

### Claim: Germany KfW financing at ~3.5%
**Status: PARTIALLY SUPPORTED**

KfW offers a range of financing rates:
- KfW Renewable Energy Standard: 1.03% annual interest rate
- KfW 124 home ownership: 3.52-3.61%
- KfW 300 climate-friendly construction: as low as 0.01%

The 3.5% figure may be conservative for grid-specific financing.

### Manufacturing Location Decisions Affected by Grid
**Status: WELL-DOCUMENTED**

**Intel Ohio Example:**
- AEP Ohio built a $95 million, 500-megawatt power substation specifically for Intel's $100 billion Ohio fab
- Intel delays pushed timeline to 2030-2031 (originally 2025)
- The substation capable of powering 500,000 homes now sits idle

**Data Center Location Decisions:**
- Wood Mackenzie tracks 134 GW of proposed data centers across the US (up from 50 GW a year ago)
- Power availability has become the deciding factor in site selection
- Timeline delays: 3-4 years now (up from 2-3 years), potentially 10 years in constrained areas
