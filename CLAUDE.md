# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **policy analysis repository**, not a software project. It contains economic analysis and policy recommendations for proactive U.S. federal investment in electricity grid infrastructure.

## Repository Structure

- **grids_for_growth.md** - Main policy document presenting the narrative argument for federal grid investment
- **grid_economics_analysis.md** - Quantitative analysis with formulas, calculations, and supporting data
- **fig1-5 (PNG files)** - Visualizations supporting the economic analysis

## Key Concepts

The documents make a case for federal proactive grid investment using:

1. **Cost of capital advantage** - Federal 2% rates vs. private 8% rates change optimal investment timing
2. **Economies of scale** - Six-tenths rule: doubling capacity costs ~52% more, not 100%
3. **REA precedent** - Rural Electrification Administration achieved >99% repayment on 2% loans
4. **Preparation delta** - 25% upfront premium enables 8x capacity at 80% lower lifecycle cost per MW

## No Build/Test Commands

This repository contains Markdown documents and images only. There are no dependencies, build processes, or tests to run.

## Working with These Documents

When editing:
- Maintain consistency between the narrative (grids_for_growth.md) and quantitative (grid_economics_analysis.md) documents
- Figures are referenced by number in both documents - keep figure numbering synchronized
- Economic formulas use standard NPV, discount rate, and power law notation
